# Blocks Analytics

A analytics plataform to dive deep into graphs, timeseries and trends for data generated by Cardano Block.

This application uses Phoenix LiveView and [Xogmios](https://github.com/wowica/xogmios), and Elixir client for Ogmios.

Xogmios is an Elixir client for the Cardano blockchain. You can use it to perform queries, stream blocks as they become available and submit transactions to the network.

It connects to a Cardano node through Ogmios.

> Ogmios is a lightweight bridge interface for a Cardano node. It offers a WebSockets API that enables local clients to speak Ouroboros' mini-protocols via JSON/RPC. - https://ogmios.dev/

It is inspired by the [blocks](https://github.com/wowica/blocks), a Cardano block explorer using Phoenix LiveView and Xogmios. You can visit the list of blocks here [https://blocks.workwithcardano.com/](https://blocks.workwithcardano.com/).

Both of the previous references were developed by [@caike](https://github.com/caike) and the [Work With Cardano](https://github.com/wowica) team.

## Objective

The purpose of this application is to collect the data related to the generated Cardano Blocks, store it on a database and transform it into a analytics dataset, so that we can create different kind of analysis.

Initially, we are planning to persists the data into the [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) database. Some research will be applied here in order to make sure this will be the best engine which fits this purpose.

There's tree main ojectives we would like to achieve while working on this project:

* Learning the DuckDB and apply the knowledge on how to create analytics platforms
* Learning how to use the [Xogmios](https://github.com/wowica/xogmios) API
* Learning on how to use [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/docs/install/phoenix/) to create rich User Interfaces with Phoenix 1.8.
* Learning more about Cardano through [Cardano Foudation Course](https://learn.academy.cardanofoundation.org/landing).

## How to use this application?

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
